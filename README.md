# ABI IT resources: a user guide
Instructions for using computing resources at ABI

## Becoming a new user

### Step 1: generate a key pair

Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/abi-am/it-resources/blob/main/access-to-server/generating_key_pair.md) to generate a key pair. After you generate your key pair, keep the private key for yourself and give the public key to the server admin. He will create a user for you with a username of your choice.

### Step 2: access the server

Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/abi-am/it-resources/blob/main/access-to-server/) to access and login to the server. 

### Step 3: where to work

When you login to the server you will appear in the home directory. Don't do anything there. You need to redirect to the /storage/users/YOURUSERNAME or the /storage2/users/YOURUSERNAME directories and keep your private files there. Please, keep your workspace tidy. Remove the intermediate files as soon as possible so that there is space left for others to work. Note, that we are very limited in space right now.
